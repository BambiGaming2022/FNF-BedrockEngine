if you downloaded this waiting for a customizable build of psych
you are out of luck, aside from the main developer (BeastlyGhost, formely known as Gui, who's writing this right now) losing time and interest on the project, this project isn't really nothing special if you think about it

everything this "engine" aimed to do is already possible on Psych nowadays, and it's really not necessary to have a "clone" of it just to have features like Noteskins and Lane Underlay

I do plan to stay on the community for a while and maybe make a project that is not just a fork of something else, nothing new and exciting, just a little passion project for me to kill some time when I'm stressed out

that was it, thanks for those who contributed to the project, stay safe!
