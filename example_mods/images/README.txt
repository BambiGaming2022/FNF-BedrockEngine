OLD ICON SUPPORT COMES BY DEFAULT, WHICH MEANS THERE WON'T BE ANY WINNING ICON
AND ENGINE WON'T USE 450X150 IMAGES. IF YOU DO NOT WANT ORIGINAL ICON SUPPORT
DELETE THE iconSupport.txt FILE THEN PUT YOUR ICONS TO mods/images/icons.
IF YOU DO WANT ORIGINAL ICON SUPPORT, DO NOT TOUCH THE iconSupport.txt AND PUT YOUR
ICONS TO mods/images/icons-old!!!
