DO NOT PUT YOUR SKINS TO ASSETS, BEDROCK WILL IGNORE ASSETS FOLDER IF YOU DON'T MESS WITH SOURCE


more options will be ported to this json file if needed.

iconSupport means 300x150 icon support.
those icons need to be placed on mods/images/icons-old


--------------NOTE SKINS---------------
Available note skins are:
-NOTE_assets
-NOTE_circle
-NOTE_bar
-NOTE_diamond
-NOTE_step
-NOTE_simplyarrow

you can also add your own noteskins
just place them on "mods/images/noteskins"

if a skin doesn't have a pixel variant, pixel stages will crash
so make sure to create or copy any existing skin to mods/pixelUI/noteskins so your noteskin won't crash

-------JUDGEMENT SKINS-------
Available judgement skins are:

-classic
-bedrock

you can also add your own judgement skins
just place them on "mods/images/judgements"

at the moment, botplay crashes no matter which noteskins or judgement skin you are using, this will be fixed soon
